# Handwashing Analysis

This project is a reanalysis of the data that led Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis to discover the importance of handwashing in reducing childbed fever deaths at the Vienna General Hospital in the 1840s. The data shows the alarming number of deaths at both Clinic 1 and Clinic 2, with a higher proportion of deaths at Clinic 1. The only difference between the clinics was that many medical students served at Clinic 1, while mostly midwife students served at Clinic 2. Semmelweis made handwashing obligatory in the summer of 1847, which drastically reduced the proportion of deaths by around 8 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval calculated using the bootstrap method. Despite the evidence, Semmelweis' discovery was rejected by the contemporary medical community, possibly due to the lack of statistical arguments in medical science at the time.
